\subsection{Insurer's Failure to Settle within Policy Limits}

\subsubsection{\emph{Crisci v. Security Ins. Co.}}

Insurers have a duty to protect the interests of their policyholders when 
considering settlements within the insured's policy limits.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Crisci owned an apartment building. One of her tenants slipped 
    through a stairway and sustained severe injuries. Her insurance company 
    litigated the dispute. It rejected settlement offers within the policy 
    limit of \$10,000, knowing that if it went to a jury the damages would 
    likely exceed \$100,000. The jury did ultimately award damages of 
    \$101,000.
    \item Crisci brought suit against the insurance company, alleging that it 
    should be liable for an award in excess of its policy limits after failing 
    to accept a settlement offer within its policy limits.\
    \item The California Supreme Court held that ``the test is whether a 
    prudent insurer without policy limits would have accepted the settlement 
    offer.''\footnote{Reader p. 85.} It found that ``the evidence is 
    clearly sufficient to support the determination that [the insurance 
    company] breached its duty to consider the interests of Mrs. Crisci in 
    proposed settlements.''\footnote{Reader p. 86.}
